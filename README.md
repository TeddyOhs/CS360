**Weight Tracking App**

Summary:
The Weight Tracking App is designed to address the user's need for monitoring their weight effectively. It provides functionalities for logging in, tracking weight changes, and sending SMS notifications based on user-defined triggers such as reaching a goal weight.

**Screens and Features:**
The necessary screens and features include:

Login Screen: Allows existing users to log in or prompts new users to create an account.
Account Creation Screen: Enables new users to register with a unique username and password.
Dashboard: Displays the user's weight tracking history in a grid format, allowing users to add, delete, and update weight entries.
SMS Permission Prompt: Requests permission from users to send SMS notifications for weight-related alerts.
SMS Notification Functionality: Sends SMS alerts to users based on predefined triggers, such as reaching a goal weight.
The UI designs prioritize simplicity and intuitiveness to ensure user-friendliness. Clear navigation paths, minimalistic layouts, and prominent call-to-action buttons are implemented to streamline the user experience. User feedback and usability testing were integral in refining the UI designs, ensuring they meet the users' needs efficiently.

**Coding Approach:**
The coding process involved adopting industry-standard best practices, including:

Consistent naming conventions and code style for readability.
Concise class structures to promote maintainability.
Frequent testing with the Android Emulator to ensure functionality and compatibility across devices.
Techniques such as modularization and separation of concerns were employed to facilitate code organization and scalability. These strategies promote code reusability and ease future maintenance.

**Testing and Functional Verification:**
Testing was conducted rigorously throughout the development process to ensure functional integrity. Emphasis was placed on:

Verifying login functionality against the database.
Testing database operations (create, delete, update, read) to ensure data integrity.
Testing SMS notification feature with both permission granted and denied scenarios.
Testing revealed potential issues and edge cases, allowing for timely resolution and refinement of the application. This iterative testing process ensures a stable and reliable user experience.

**Innovation and Challenges:**
Innovation was required in overcoming challenges such as:

Implementing secure user authentication and password hashing to ensure data privacy.
Integrating SMS functionality while gracefully handling permission denial scenarios.
Designing a responsive and intuitive UI for seamless navigation across various screens.
Creative problem-solving and collaborative brainstorming were instrumental in addressing these challenges effectively.

App Launch Plan:

**App Description and Icon:**

The app description will highlight its functionality for weight tracking and goal management, emphasizing its user-friendly interface and SMS notification feature.
The icon will feature a minimalist design incorporating scales or a weight symbol to represent the app's purpose effectively.
The app will request permissions for accessing SMS functionality and storing user data securely. Unnecessary permissions will be avoided to uphold user privacy and trust.

**Monetization Plan:**
The app may offer a free version supported by ads, with an option for users to upgrade to an ad-free premium version through a one-time payment. Additional monetization strategies, such as in-app purchases for premium features, could be explored in future updates.
